# Game-Based Java Learning Platform

Team Name: Adaptive Coders  
Hackathon: YUKTI 1.0  
Theme: Smart Education  

## Problem
Students practice Java questions randomly without knowing their weak topics, which leads to inefficient learning.

## Solution
A game-based Java learning platform that tracks topic-wise performance and recommends practice questions from weak topics using gamified levels, XP, streaks and rewards.

## Planned Technology Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
- Database: MySQL
- Version Control: GitHub

## Architecture
The frontend communicates with backend REST APIs.
The backend handles game logic, progress tracking and weak-topic detection.
Data is stored in local JSON.

## Status
This repository currently contains the project proposal and architecture.
Implementation will be done during the hackathon development phase.
